Let’s go. Install R First, let’s get the right programs installed on your computer. Then we will explain what they are and why you need them. First, download and install R: Go to the following website, click the Download button, and follow the website’s instructions from there. https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/ Install RStudio Second, download and install RStudio: Go to the following website and choose the free Desktop version: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Third, make sure RStudio opens successfully: Open the RStudio app. A window should appear that looks like this: Fourth, make sure R is running correctly in the background: In RStudio, in the pane on the left (the “Console”), type 2+2 and hit Enter. If R is working properly, the number “4” will be printed in the next line down. Finally, some minor adjustments to make RStudio run smoother (and look cooler): Go to Tools &gt; Global Options and make sure your General settings match these exactly: Specifically, uncheck the option under Workspace to ‘Restore .RData into workspace at startup.’ Now go to the Appearance settings and choose a cool theme! Boom! You’ve got R up and running. Now it’s time to install some packages. Install packages Packages are what makes R so great. To install a package, open Rstudio, make sure you’re connected to Wi-Fi, and type the following code into the “Console” in the bottom left Did that work? Probably not, because “packagename” is not a real R package. The packages we’ll be using are the following: tidyverse RColorBrewer leaflet ggthemes rmarkdown sp To install all of these, you can run install.packages for each package: install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;) install.packages(&#39;RColorBrewer&#39;) # etc., etc. So, now you’ve got R, RStudio, and some cool packages. Good job. You’re ready for the next module.

You will get a tour of RStudio in the next module. For now, look at the left half of the screen. You should see a large pane entitled the Console. RStudio’s Console is your window into R, the engine under the hood. The Console is where you type commands for R to run, and where R prints back the results of what you have told it to do. Think of the Console as a chatroom, where you and R talk back and forth. 3.1 Running R code in the Console Type your first command into the Console, then press Enter: 1 + 1 [1] 2 When you press Enter, you send your line of code to R; you post it for R to see. Then R takes it, does some processing, and posts a result (2) just below your command. Note that spaces don’t matter. Both of the following two commands are legible to R and return the same thing: 4+4 [1] 8 4 + 4 [1] 8 However, it is better to make your code as easy to read as possible, which usually means using a single space between numbers: 4 + 4 [1] 8 Try typing in other basic calculations: R as a calculator As you can tell from those commands you just ran, R is, at heart, a fancy calculator. Some calculations are straightforward, like addition and subtraction: 490 + 1000 [1] 1490 490 - 1000 [1] -510 Division is pretty straightfoward too: 24 / 2 [1] 12 For multiplication, use an asterisk (*): 24 * 2 [1] 48 You denote exponents like this: 2 ^2 [1] 4 2 ^3 [1] 8 2 ^4 [1] 16 Finally, note that R is fine with negative numbers: 9 + -100 [1] -91 Re-running code If you want to re-run the code you just ran, or if you want to recall the code so that you can adjust it slightly, click anywhere in the Console then press your keyboard’s Up arrow. If you keep pressing your Up arrow, R will present you with sequentially older commands. R keeps a history of everything you have said to it since you opened this window. If you accidentally recalled an old command without meaning to, you can reset the Console’s command line by pressing Escape. Incomplete commands Similar to talking to a friend, if you start a sentence and don’t finish it, your friend will get confused. R gets confused when you enter an incomplete command, and will wait for you to write the remainder of your command on the next line in the Console before doing anything. For example, try running this code in your Console: 45 - You will find that R gives you a little + sign on the line under your command, which means it is waiting for you to complete your command. If you want to complete your command, add a number (e.g., 3) and hit Enter. You should now be given an answer (e.g., 48). Or, if instead you want R to stop waiting and stop running, just press the Escape key. Getting errors R only understands your commands if they follow the rules of the R language (often referred to as its syntax). If R does not understand your code, it will throw an error and give up on trying to execute that line of code. For example, try running this code in your Console: 4 + y You probably received a message in red font stating: Error: object 'y' not found. That is because R did know how to interpret the symbol y in this case, so it just gave up. Get used to errors! They happen all the time, even (especially?) to professionals, and it is essential that you get used to reading your own code to find and fix its errors. Here’s another piece of code that will produce an error: dfjkltr9fitwt985ut9e3 Using parentheses R is usually great about following classic rules for Order of Operations, and you can use parentheses to exert control over that order. For example, these two commands produce different results: 2*7 - 2*5 / 2 [1] 9 (2*7 - 2*5) / 2 [1] 2 Note that parentheses need to come in pairs: whenever you type an open parenthesis, (, eventually you need to provide a corresponding closed parenthesis, ). The following line of code will return a plus sign, +, since R is waiting for you to close the parenthetical before it processes your command: 4 + (5 Remember: parentheses come in pairs! The same goes for other types of brackets: {...} and [...]. You can ask R basic questions using operators. For example, you can ask whether two values are equal to each other. 96 == 95 [1] FALSE 95 + 2 == 95 + 2 [1] TRUE R is telling you that the first statement is FALSE (96 is not, in fact, equal to 95) and that the second statement is TRUE (95 + 2 is, in fact, equal to itself). Note the use of double equal signs here. You must use two of them in order for R to understand that you are asking for this logical test. You can also ask if two values are NOT equal to each other: 96 != 95 [1] TRUE 95 + 2 != 95 + 2 [1] FALSE This test is a bit more difficult to understand: In the first statement, R is telling you that it is TRUE that 96 is different from 95. In the second statement, R is saying that it is FALSE that 95 + 2 is not the same as itself. Note that R lets you write these tests another, even more confusing way: ! 96 == 95 [1] TRUE ! 95 + 2 == 95 + 2 [1] FALSE The first line of code is asking R whether it is not true that 96 and 95 are equal to each other, which is TRUE. The second line of code is asking R whether it is not true that 95 + 2 is the same as itself, which is of course FALSE. Other commonly used operators in R include greater than / less than symbols (&gt; and &lt;, also known as the left-facing alligator and right-facing alligator), and greater/less than or equal to (&gt;= and &lt;=). 100 &gt; 100 [1] FALSE 100 &gt;= 100 [1] TRUE (100 != 100) == FALSE [1] TRUE Use built-in R functions R has some built-in “functions” for common calculations, such as finding square roots and logarithms. Functions are packages of code that take a given value, transform it according to some internal code instructions, and provide an output. You will learn more about functions in a few modules. To find the square-root of a number, use the ‘squirt’ command, sqrt(): sqrt(16) Note the use of parentheses here. When you are calling a function, when you see parentheses, think of the word ‘of’. This line translates to ‘the square root of 16’. You are taking the sqrt of the number inside the parenthetical. To get the log of a value: log(4) Note that the function log() is the natural log function (i.e., the value that e must be raised to in order to equal 4). To calculate a base-10 logarithm, use log10( ). log(10) log10(10) Another handy function is round(), for rounding numbers to a specific number of decimal places. 100/3 round(100/3) round(100/3,digits=1) round(100/3,digits=2) round(100/3,digits=3) Finally, R also comes with some built-in values, such as pi: pi Congratulations!

What this is, and what it isn’t What you will learn Where did this come from", " Module 4 Welcome! Learning goals Learn what this course is about Learn about the why Start coding   What this is, and what it isn’t This is not a textbook or an encyclopedia. This is not a reference manual. It is not exhaustive or comprehensive. So what is this? This guide is an accelerator, an incubator designed to guide you along the most direct path from your first line of code to becoming a capable researcher. Our goal is to help you through the most dangerous period in your data science education: your very first steps. The first three weeks. That is when 99% percent of people give up on learning to code. But it doesn’t need to be this way. This approach is based on three core premises: Premise 1: We learn best by doing. Our goal is to get you doing data science. We will keep theory and detail to a minimum. We will give you the absolute basics, then offer you exercises and puzzles that motivate you to learn the rest. Then, once you’ve been doing data science for a bit, you soon begin thinking like a data scientist. By that, we mean tackling ambiguous problems with persistence, independence, and creative problem solving. Premise 2: We learn best with purpose. Once you gain comfort with the basic skills, you will be able to start working on real data, for real projects, with real impact. You will start to care about what you are coding. And that is when the learning curve skyrockets – because you are motivated, and because you are learning reactively, instead of preemptively. Our goal is to get you to the point of take-off as quickly as possible. Premise 3: A simple toolbox is all you need to build a house. Once you become comfortable with a few basic coding tools, you can build pretty much anything. The toolbox doesn’t need to be that big; if you know how to use your tools well, and if you have enough building supplies (i.e., data), the possibilities are limitless. One more thing that this is not: This is not a fancy interactive tutorial with bells or whistles. We purposefully designed this to be simple and “analog”. You will not be typing your code into this website and getting feedback from a robot, or setting up an account to track your progress, or getting pretty merit badges or points when you complete each module. Instead, you will be doing your work on your own machine, working with real folders and files, downloading data and moving it around, etc. – all the things you will be doing as a real data scientist in the real world. What you will learn As you are learning to code, we will sprinkle in conceptual foundations and motivations for this work: what data science is, why it matters, and ethical issues surrounding it: the good, the bad, and the ugly. The most important thing, at first, is to start writing code. The entire point of this course is to learn how to use R (in RStudio). Here you will add the first and most important tools to your toolbox: working with variables, vectors, dataframes, scripts, and file directories. You will gain the skills to bring in your own data and work with it in R. You will learn how to produce beautiful plots and how to reorganize, filter, and summarize your datasets. You will also learn how to conduct basic statistics, from exploratory data analyses (e.g., producing and comparing distributions) to significance testing. If and when you conquer all of the above, we will provide various puzzles that allow you to apply the basic R skills from the previous unit to fun questions and scenarios. In each of these exercises, questions are arranged in increasing order of difficulty, so that beginners will not feel stuck right out of the gate, nor will experienced coders become bored. This is where you really begin to cut your teeth on real-world data puzzles: figuring out how to use the R tools in your toolbag to tackle an ambiguous problem and deliver an excellent data product.

These two entities are similar, but it is important to understand how they are different. In short, R is a open-source (i.e., free) coding language: a powerful programming engine that can be used to do really cool things with data. R Studio, in contrast, is a free user interface that helps you interact with R. If you think of R as an engine, then it helps to think of RStudio as the car that contains it. Like a car,RStudio makes it easier and more comfortable to use the engine to get where you want to go. R Studio needs R in order to function, but R can technically be used on its own outside of RStudio if you want. However, just as a good car mechanic can get an engine to run without being installed within a car, using R on its own is a bit clunky and requires some expertise. For beginners (and everyone else, really), R is just so much more pleasant to use when you are operating it from within RStudio. RStudio also has increasingly powerful extensions that make R even more useful and versatile in data science. These extensions allow you to use R to make interactive data dashboards, beautiful and reproducible data reports, presentations, websites, and even books. And new features like these are regularly being added to RStudio by its all-star team of data scientists. That is why this book always uses RStudio when working with R. Two-minute tour of RStudio When you open RStudio for the first time, you will see a window that looks like the screenshot below. Console You are already acquainted with RStudio’s Console, the window pane on the left that you use to “talk” to R. (See Preparing for R Training Module.) Environment In the top right pane, the Environment, RStudio will maintain a list of all the datasets, variables, and functions that you are using as you work. The next modules will explain what variables and functions are. Files, Plots, Packages, &amp; Help You will use the bottom right pane very often. The Files tab lets you see all the files within your working directory, which will be explained in the section below. The Plots tab lets you see the plots you are producing with your code. The Packages tab lets you see the packages you currently have installed on your computer. Packages are bundles of R functions downloaded from the internet; they will be explained in detail a few modules down the road. The Help tab is very important! It lets you see documentation (i.e., user’s guides) for the functions you use in your code. Functions will also be explained in detail a few modules down the road. These three panes are useful, but the most useful window pane of all is actually missing when you first open RStudio. This important pane is where you work with scripts. Scripts Before explaining what scripts are and why they are awesome, let’s start a new script. To start a new script, go to the top left icon in the RStudio window, and click on the green plus sign with a blank page behind it: A dropdown window will appear. Select “R Script”. A new window pane will then appear in the top left quadrant of your RStudio window: You now have a blank script to work in! Now type some simple commands into your script: 2 + 10 16 * 32 Notice that when you press Enter after each line of code, nothing happens in the Console. In order to send this code to the Console, press Enter + Command at the same time (or Enter + Control, if you are on Windows) for each line of code. To send both lines of code to the Console at once, select both lines of code and hit Enter + Command. (To select multiple lines of code, you can (1) click and drag with your mouse or (2) hold down your Shift key while clicking your down arrow key. To select all lines of code, press Command + A.) So let’s build up this script. Add a few more lines to your script, such that your script now looks like this. 2 + 10 16 * 32 1080 / 360 500 - 600 Run all of these lines of code at once. Now add 10 to the first number in each row, and re-run all of the code. Think about how much more efficient part (B) was thanks to your script! If you had typed all of that directly into your Console, you would have to recall or retype each line individually. That difference builds up when your number of commands grows into the hundreds. What is an R script, and why are scripts so awesome? An R script is a file where you can keep a record of your code. Just as a script tells actors exactly what to say and when to say it, an R script tells R exactly what code to run, and in what order to run it. When working with R, you will almost always type your code into a script first, then send it to the Console. You can run your code immediately using Enter + Command, but you also have a script of what you have done so that you can run the exact same code at a later time To understand why R scripts are so awesome, consider a typical workflow in Excel of GoogleSheets. You open a big complicated spreadsheet, spend hours making changes, and save your changes frequently throughout your work session. The main disadvantages of this workflow are that: There is no detailed record of the changes you have made. You cannot prove that you have made changes correctly. You cannot pass the original dataset to someone else and ask them to revise it in the same way you have. (Nor would you want to, since making all those changes was so time-consuming!) Nor could you take a different dataset and guarantee that you are able to apply the exact same changes that you applied to the first. In other words, your work is not reproducible. Making those changes is labor-intensive! Rather than spend time manually making changes to a single spreadsheet, it would be better to devote that energy to writing R code that makes those changes for you. That code could be run in this one case, but it could also be run at any later time, or easily modified to make similar changes to other spreadsheets. Unless you are an advanced Excel programmer, you are probably modifying your original dataset, which is always dangerous and a big No-No in data science. Each time you save your work in Excel or GoogleSheets (which automatically saves each change you make), the original spreadsheet file gets replaced by the updated version. But if you brought your dataset into R instead, and modified it using an R script, then you leave the raw data alone and keep it safe. (Sure, you can always save different versions of your Excel file, but then you run the risk of mixing up versions and getting confused.) Working with R scripts allows you to avoid all of these pitfalls. When you write an R script, you are making your work …. Efficient. Once you get comfortable writing R code, you will be able to write scripts in a few minutes. Those scripts can modify datasets within seconds (or less) in ways that would take hours (or years) to carry out manually in Excel or GoogleSheets. Reproducible. Once you have written anR script, you can reproduce your own work whenever you want to. You can send your script to a colleague so that they can reproduct your work as well. Reproducible work is defensible work. Low-risk. Since your R script does not make any changes to the original data, you are keeping your data safe. It is essential to preserve the sanctity of raw data! Note that there is nothing fancy or special about an R script. An R script is a simple text file; that is, it only accepts basic text; you can’t add images or change font style or font size in an R script; just letters, numbers, and your other keyboard keys. The file’s extension, .R tells your computer to interpret that text as R code. Commenting your code Another advantage of scripts is that you can include comments throughout your code to explain what you are doing and why. A comment is just a part of your script that is useful to you but that is ignored by R. To add comments to your code, use the hashtag symbol (#). Any text following a # will be ignored by R. Here is the script above, now with comments added: # Define variable x x &lt;- 2 x # Make a new variable, y, based on x y &lt;- x*56 z &lt;- y / 23 # Make a third variable, z, based on y x + y + z # Now get the sum of all three variables Adding comments can be more work, but in the end it saves you time and makes your code more effective. Comments might not seem necessary in the moment, but it is amazing how helpful they are when you come back to your code the next day. Frequent and helpful comments make the difference between good and great code. Comment early, comment often! You can also use lines of hashtags to visually organize your code. For example: ############################################## # Setup ############################################## # Define variable x x &lt;- 2 x # Make a new variable, y, based on x y &lt;- x*56 z &lt;- y / 23 # Make a third variable, z, based on y ############################################## # Get result ############################################## x + y + z # Now get the sum of all three variables This might not seem necessary with a 5-line script, but adding visual breaks to your code becomes immensely helpful when your code grows to be hundreds of lines long. Saving your work R scripts are only useful if you save them! Unlike working with GoogleDocs or GoogleSheets, R will not automatically save your changes; you have to do that yourself. (This is inconvenient, but it is also safer; most of coding is trial and error, and sometimes you want to be careful about what is saved.) Step 1: Decide where to save your work. The folder in which you save your R script will be referred to as your working directory (see the next section). For the sake of these tutorials, it will be most convenient to save all of your scripts in a single folder that is in an easily accessed location. Step 2: In that location, make a new folder named bRazzaville: We suggest making a new folder on your Desktop and naming it bRazzaville, but you can name it whatever you want and place it wherever you want. Step 3: Save your script in that folder To save the script you have opened and typed a few lines of code into, press Command + S (or Control + S). Alternatively, go to File &gt; Save. Navigate to the folder you just created and type in a file name that is simple but descriptive. We suggest making a new R script for each module, and naming those scripts according to each module’s name. In this case, we recommend naming your script intro_to_scripts. (It is good practice to avoid spaces in your file names; it will be essential later on, so good to begin the correct habit now. Start using an underscore, _, instead of a space.) Your working directory When you work with data in R, R will need to know where in your computer to look for that data. The folder it looks in is known as your working directory. To find out which folder R is currently using as your working directory, use the function getwd(): getwd() [1] &quot;C:/Users/htzt324/OneDrive - University of Leeds/Desktop/Nika/CongoFor1.5/bRazzaville_training&quot; Almost always, you want to set your working directory to the folder your R script is in. How to set your working directory Whenever you begin a new R script, setting your working directory will be one of the first things you do. There are three ways to set your working directory: Manually without code. On the top banner in RStudio, go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File Location: This action sets your working directory to the same folder that your R script is in. When you do this, you will see that a command has been entered into your Console: setwd(&quot;~/Desktop/bRazzaville&quot;) (Note that the filepath may be different on your machine.) This code is using the function setwd(), which is also used in the next option. Go ahead and copy this setwd(...) code and paste it into your script, so it will be easy to use next time. Manually with code, using setwd(): You can manually provide the filepath you want to set as your working directory. This option allows you to set your wd to whatever folder you want. The character string within the setwd() command is the path to a folder. The formatting of this string must be exact, otherwise R will throw an error. Use option 1 at first to get a sense of how your computer formats its folder paths. Copy, paste, and modify the output from option 1 in order to type your path correctly. Automatically with code: There is a command you can run that automatically sets your working directory to the folder that your R script is in. This is the most efficient and useful method, in our experience. To use this command, you must first install a new package. Run this code: install.packages(&quot;rstudioapi&quot;) library(rstudioapi) For now, you do not need to understand what this code is doing. We will explain packages and the library() function in a later module. You can now copy, paste, and run this code to set your working directory automatically: setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) This is a complicated line of code that you need not understand. As long as it works, it works! Confirm that R is using the correct working directory with the command getwd(). Typical workflows Now that you know how to create a script and set your working directory, you are prepared to work on data projects in RStudio. The workflow for beginning a new data project typically goes like this: In your file explorer… Create a folder for your project somewhere on your computer. This will become your working directory. Create subfolders within your working directory, if you want. We recommend creating a data subfolder, for keeping data, and a z subfolder, for keeping miscellaneous documents. The goal is to keep your working directory visually simple and organized; ideally, the only files not within subfolders are your R scripts. Add data to your working directory, if you have any. In RStudio … Create a new R script. Save it inside your intended working directory. At the top of your script, use comments to add a title, author info, and brief description. Add the code to set your working directory. Begin coding! Template R script Here is a template you can use to copy and paste into each new script you create: ################################################################################ # &lt; Add title here &gt; ################################################################################ # # &lt; Add brief description here &gt; # # &lt; Author &gt; # Created on &lt;add date here &gt; # ################################################################################ # Set working directory setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) ################################################################################ ################################################################################ # Code goes here ################################################################################ # (end of file) Exercises 1 (if not already complete). Create a working directory for this course. Call it whatever you like, but bRazzaville could work great. Place it somewhere convenient on your computer, such as your Desktop. 2. Within this working directory, create three new folders: (1) a data folder, which is where you will store the data files we will be using in subsequent modules and (2) a modules folder, which is where you will keep the code you use to work on the material in these modules. 3. Now follow the Typical Workflow instructions above to create a script. Save it within your modules folder. Name it template.R. Copy and paste the template R code provided above into this file, and save it. This is now a template that you can use to easily create new scripts for this course. 4. Now make a copy of template.R to stage a script that you can use in the next module. To do so, in RStudio go to the top banner and click File &gt; Save As. Save this new script as variables.R (because the next module is called Variables in R). 5. Modify the code in variables.R so that you are prepared to begin the next module. Change the title, and look ahead to the next module to fill in a brief description. Don’t forget to add your name as the author and specify today’s date. Boom! Other Resources A Gentle Introduction to R from the RStudio team "],["review-your-r-training-prep.html", "Module 6 Review your R Training Prep", " Module 6 Review your R Training Prep Prior to arriving in Brazzaville, we asked that you download R and RStudio and do some preparatory work. Let’s work through some of that information together. Exercises Use R like a calculator 1. Type a command in the Console to determine the sum of 596 and 198. 2. Re-run the sum of 596 and 198 without re-typing it. 3. Recall the command again, but this time adjust the code to find the sum of 596 and 298. 4. Practice escaping an accidentally called command: recall your most recent command, then press the right key to clear the Console’s command line.   Recalling commands 5. Find the sum of the ages of everyone in your immediate family. 6. Now recall that command and adjust it to determine the average age of the members of your family. 7. Find the square root of pi and round the answer to the 2 decimal places.   Finding errors 8. This line of code won’t run; instead, R will wait for more with a + symbol. Find the problem and re-write the code so that it works. 5 * 6 + 9. The same goes for this line of code. Fix it, too. sqrt(16 10. This line of code will trigger an error. Find the problem and re-write the code so that it works. round(100/3,digits+3) 11. Type a command of your own into R that throws an error, then recall the command and revise so that R can understand it.   Show that the following statements are TRUE: 12. pi is greater than the square root of 9 13. It is FALSE that the square root of 9 is greater than pi 14. pi rounded to the nearest whole number equals the square root of 9   Asking TRUE / FALSE questions 15. Write and run a line of code that asks whether these two calculations return the same result: 2*7 - 2*5 / 2 (2*7 - 2*5) / 2 [1] 2 16. Now write and run a line of code that asks whether the first calculation is larger than the second: "],["variables.html", "Module 7 Variables Introducing variables Types of data in R", " Module 7 Variables Learning goals How to define variables and work with them in R Learn the various possible classes of data in R Introducing variables So far we have strictly been using R as a calculator, with commands such as: 3 + 5 [1] 8 Of course, R can do much, much more than these basic computations. Your first step in uncovering the potential of R is learning how to use variables. In R, a variable is a convenient way of referring to an underlying value. That value can be as simple as a single number (e.g., 6), or as complex as a spreadsheet that is many Gigabytes in size. It may be useful to think of a variable as a cup; just as cups make it easy to hold your coffee and carry it from the kitchen to the couch, variables make it easy to contain and work with data. Declaring variables To assign numbers or other types of data to a variable, you use the &lt; and - characters to make the arrow symbol &lt;-. x &lt;- 3+5 As the direction of the &lt;- arrow suggests, this command stores the result of 3 + 5 into the variable x. Unlike before, you did not see 8 printed to the Console. That is because the result was stored into x. Calling variables If you wanted R to tell you what x is, just type the variable name into the Console and run that command: x [1] 8 Want to create a variable but also see its value at the same time? Here’s a handy trick: put your command in parentheses: (x &lt;- 3*12) [1] 36 When you do that, x gets assigned a value, then that value is printed to the console. You can also update variables. (x &lt;- x * 3) [1] 108 (x &lt;- x * 3) [1] 324 You can also add variables together. x &lt;- 8 y &lt;- 4.5 x + y [1] 12.5 Naming variables Here are a few rules: 1. A variable name has to have at least one letter in it. These examples work: 2. A variable name has to be connected. No spaces! It is usually best to represent a space using a period (.) or an underscore (_). Note that periods and underscores can be used in variable names: my.variable &lt;- 5 # periods can be used my_variable &lt;- 5 # underscores can be used However, hyphens cannot be used, since that symbol is used for subtraction. 3. Variables are case-sensitive. If you misspell a variable name, you will confuse R and get an error. For example, ask R to tell you the value of capital X. The error message will be Error: object 'X' not found, which means R looked in its memory for an object (i.e., a variable) named X and could not find one. 4. Variable names can be as complicated or as simple as you want. 5. Some names need to be avoided, since R uses them for special purposes. For example, data should be avoided, as should mean, since both are functions built-in to R and R is liable to interpret them as such instead of as a variable containing your data. supercalifragilistic.expialidocious &lt;- 5 supercalifragilistic.expialidocious # still works [1] 5 So those are the basic rules, but naming variables well is a bit of an art. The trick is using names that are clear but are not so complicated that typing them is tedious or prone to errors. Note that R uses a feature called ‘Tab complete’ to help you type variable names. Begin typing a variable name, such as supercalifragilistic.expialidocious from the example above, but after the first few letters press the Tab key. R will then give you options for auto-completing your word. Press Tab again, or Enter, to accept the auto-complete. This is a handy way to avoid typos. Types of data in R So far we have been working exclusively with numeric data. But there are many different data types in R. We call these “types” of data classes: Decimal values like 4.5 are called numeric data. Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics. Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical data. Text (or string) values are called character data. In order to be combined, data have to be the same class. R is able to compute the following commands … x &lt;- 6 y &lt;- 4 x + y [1] 10 … but not these: x &lt;- 6 y &lt;- &quot;4&quot; x + y That’s because the quotation marks used in naming y causes R to interpret y as a character class. To see how R is interpreting variables, you can use the class() function: x &lt;- 100 class(x) [1] &quot;numeric&quot; x &lt;- &quot;100&quot; class(x) [1] &quot;character&quot; x &lt;- 100 == 101 class(x) [1] &quot;logical&quot; Another data type to be aware of is factors, but we will deal with them later. Exercises Finding the errors 1. This code will produce an error. Can you find the problem and fix it so that this code will work? # Assign 5 to a variable my_var &lt; 5 2. Same for this one: # Assign 5 to a variable my_var == 5 3. Same for this one: x &lt;- 5 y &lt;- 1 X + y   Your Bananas-to-ICS ratio 4. Estimate how many bananas you’ve eaten in your lifetime and store that value in a variable (choose whatever name you wish). (By the way, what is a good method for estimating this as accurately as you can?) 5. Now estimate how many ice cream sandwiches you’ve eaten in your lifetime and store that in a different variable. 6. Now use these variables to calculate your Banana-to-ICS ratio. Store your result in a third variable, then call that variable in the Console to see your ratio. 7. Who in the class has the highest ratio? Who has the lowest?   Creating boolean variables 8. Assign a FALSE statement of your choosing to a variable of whatever name you wish. 9. Confirm that the class of this variable is “logical.” 10. Confirm that the variable equals FALSE.   Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius: 11. Assign a variable fahrenheit the numerical value of 32. 12. Assign a variable celsius to equal the conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Unless you’re a meteorology nerd, you may need to Google the equation for this conversion. 13. Print the value of celsius to the Console. 14. Now use this code to determine the Celsius equivalent of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.   Wrapping up 15. Now ensure that your entire script is properly commented, and make sure your script is saved in your bRazzaville working directory before closing. "],["vectors.html", "Module 8 Vectors Declaring and using vectors Math with two vectors Functions for handling vectors Subsetting vectors", " Module 8 Vectors Learning goals Learn the various structures of data in R How to work with vectors in R   Data belong to different classes, as explained in the previous module, and they can be arranged into various structures. So far we have been dealing only with variables that contain a single value, but the real value of R comes from assigning entire sets of data to a variable. The simplest data structure in R is a vector. A vector is simply a set of values. A vector can contain only a single value, as we have been working with thus far, or it can contain many millions of values. Declaring and using vectors To build up a vector in R, use the function c(), which is short for “concatenate”. x &lt;- c(5,6,7,8) x [1] 5 6 7 8 Whenever you use the c() function, you are telling R: ‘Hey, get ready. I’m about to give you more than one value at once.’. Cough Cough. You can use the c() function to concatenate two vectors together: x &lt;- c(5,6,7,8) y &lt;- c(9,10,11,12) z &lt;- c(x,y) z [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 You can also use c() to add values to a vector: x &lt;- c(5,6,7,8) x &lt;- c(x,9) x [1] 5 6 7 8 9 You can also put vectors through logical tests: x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5) 4 == x [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE This command is asking R to tell you whether each element in x is equal to 4. You can create vectors of any data class (i.e., data type). x &lt;- c(&quot;Greta&quot;,&quot;Nika&quot;,&quot;Crispin&quot;) x [1] &quot;Greta&quot; &quot;Nika&quot; &quot;Crispin&quot; y &lt;- c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE) y [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE Note that all values within a vector must be of the same class. You can’t combine numerics and characters into the same vector. If you did, R would try to convert the numbers to characters. For example: x &lt;- 4 y &lt;- &quot;6&quot; z &lt;- c(x,y) z [1] &quot;4&quot; &quot;6&quot; Math with two vectors When two vectors are of the same length, you can do arithmetic with them: x &lt;- c(5,6,7,8) y &lt;- c(9,10,11,12) x + y [1] 14 16 18 20 x - y [1] -4 -4 -4 -4 x * y [1] 45 60 77 96 x / y [1] 0.5555556 0.6000000 0.6363636 0.6666667 What happens when two vectors are not the same length? Well, it depends. If one vector is length 1 (i.e., a single number), then things usually work out well. x &lt;- 5 y &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10) x + y [1] 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 In this command, the single element of x gets added to each element of y. Another example, which you already saw above: a &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5) b &lt;- 4 a == b [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE In this command, the single element of b gets compared to each element of a. However, when both vectors contain multiple values but are not the same length, be warned: wonky things can happen. This is because R will start recycling the shorter vector: a &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5) b &lt;- c(3,4) a + b [1] 4 6 6 8 8 As this warning implies, this doesn’t make much sense. The command will still run, but do not trust the result. Functions for handling vectors We are about to list a bunch of core functions for working with vectors. Think of this like a toolbag. Each tool has a specific purpose and limited value: you can’t quite build a house with just a hammer. But when you learn how to use all of the tools in your tool bag together, you can build almost anything. But you have to know how to use each tool individually first. length() tells you the number of elements in a vector: x &lt;- c(5,6) length(x) [1] 2 y &lt;- c(9,10,11,12) length(y) [1] 4 The colon symbol : creates a vector with every integer occurring between a min and max: x &lt;- 1:10 x [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 seq() allows you to build a vector using evenly spaced sequence of values between a min and max: seq(0,100,length=11) [1] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 In this command, you are telling R to give you a sequence of values from 0 to 100, and you want the length of that vector to be 11. R then figures out the spacing required between each value in order to make that happen. Alternatively, you can prescribe the interval between values instead of the length: seq(0,100,by=7) [1] 0 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84 91 98 rep() allows you to repeat a single value a specified number of times: rep(&quot;Hey!&quot;,times=5) [1] &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; You can also use rep() to repeat each element of a vector a set number of times: rep(c(&quot;Hey!&quot;,&quot;Wohoo!&quot;),each=3) [1] &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Wohoo!&quot; &quot;Wohoo!&quot; &quot;Wohoo!&quot; head() and tail() can be used to retrieve the first 6 or last 6 elements in a vector, respectively. x &lt;- 1:1000 head(x) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 tail(x) [1] 995 996 997 998 999 1000 You can also adjust how many elements to return: head(x,2) [1] 1 2 tail(x,10) [1] 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 1000 sort() allows you to order a vector from its smallest value to its largest: x &lt;- c(4,8,1,6,9,2,7,5,3) sort(x) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 rev() lets you reverse the order of elements within a vector: x &lt;- c(4,8,1,6,9,2,7,5,3) rev(x) [1] 3 5 7 2 9 6 1 8 4 rev(sort(x)) [1] 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 min() and max() lets you find the smallest and largest value in a vector. min(x) [1] 1 max(x) [1] 9 which() allows you to ask, “For which elements of a vector is the following statement true?” x &lt;- 1:10 which(x==4) [1] 4 If no values within the vector meet the condition, a vector of length zero will be returned: x &lt;- 1:10 which(x == 11) integer(0) which.min() and which.max() tells you which element is the smallest and largest in the vector, respectively: which.min(x) [1] 1 which.max(x) [1] 10 %in% is a handy operator that allows you to ask whether a value occurs within a vector: x &lt;- 1:10 4 %in% x [1] TRUE 11 %in% x [1] FALSE is.na() is a way of asking whether a vector contains missing, broken, or erroneous values. In R, such values are referred to using the phrase NA. When you see NA, think of R telling you, ‘Nah ah! Nope! Not Available!’ x &lt;- c(3,5,7,NA,9,4) is.na(x) [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE This function is stepping through each element in the vector x and telling you whether that element is NA. Subsetting vectors Since you will eventually be working with vectors that contain thousands of data points, it will be useful to have some tools for subsetting them – that is, looking at only a few select elements at a time. You can subset a vector using square brackets [ ]. Whenever you use you use brackets, you are telling R: ‘Hey, I want some numbers, but not everything: just certain ones.’ x &lt;- 50:100 x[10] [1] 59 This command is asking R to return the 10th element in the vector x. x[10:20] [1] 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 This command is asking R to return elements 10:20 in the vector x. Error in file(filename, &quot;r&quot;, encoding = encoding): cannot open the connection Error in teacher_tip(tip): could not find function &quot;teacher_tip&quot; Exercises Creating sequences of numbers Use the colon symbol to create a vector of length 5 between a minimum and a maximum value of your choosing. Create a second vector of length 5 using the seq() function. Use code to confirm that the length of this vector is 5. Create a third vector of length 5 using the rep() function. Use code to confirm that the length of this vector is 5. Finally, concatenate the three vectors and check that the length equals 15.   Basic vector math Create a variable x that is a list of numbers of any size. Create a variable y of the same length. Check to see if each values of x is greater than each value of y. Check to see if the smallest value of x is greater than or equal to the average value of y.   Vectors and object classes Create a vector with at least one number, then a second vector with at least one character string, then a third vector with at least one logical value. Identify the class of all three vectors. Now concatenate these three vectors into a fourth vector. Identify the class of this fourth vector.   Heads &amp; tails Create a vector with at least 15 values. Show the first six values of that vector using the head() function. Figure out how to show the same result without a function, but instead with your new vector subsetting skills. Now replicate the tail() function, using those same skills. You may need to call the length() function as well.   Shoe sizes Create a vector called shoes, which contains the shoe sizes of five people sitting near you. Use comments to keep track of which size is whose. Arrange this set of shoe sizes in ascending order. Arrange this set of shoe sizes in descending order. Use code to find the the two largest shoe sizes in your vector. Don’t use subsetting; instead, write a line of code that would work even if more shoes were added to your vector. What is the shoe size is closest to the mean of these shoe sizes? Use the which() function to figure out which of your five neighbors this shoe size belongs to.   Swimming timelines Now create a new vector called swim_days, which contains the number of days since those same five people last went swimming (in any body of water; estimating the days since is fine). Use code to ask whether anyone went swimming less than five days ago. Which of your neighbors, if any, went swimming in the last month? Which of your neighbors, if any, have not been swimming the last month? On average, how long has it been since these people have gone swimming?   Dealing with NAs Create a vector named x with these values: c(4,7,1,NA,9,2,8). Use a function to decide whether or not each element of x is NA. Use another function to find out which element in x is NA. Write code that will subset x only to those values that are NA. Write code that will subset x only to those values that are not NA.   Sleep deficits Now create a vector called sleep_time with the number of hours you slept for each day in the last week. Check if you slept more on day 3 than day 7. Get the total number of hours slept in the last week. Get the average number of hours slept in the last week. Check if the total number of hours in the first 3 days is less than the total number of hours in the last 4 days. Now create an object named over_under. This should be the difference between how much you slept each night and 8 hours (ie, 1.5 means you slept 9.5 hours and -2 means you slept 8 hours). Write code to use over_under to calculate your sleep deficit / surplus this week (ie, the total hours over/under the amount of sleep you would have gotten had you slept 8 hours every night). Write code to get the minimum number of hours you slept this week. Write code to calculate how many hours of sleep you would have gotten had you sleep the minimum number of hours every night. Write code to calculate the average of the hours of sleep you got on the 3rd through 6th days of the week. Write code to calculate how many hours of sleep you would get in a year if you were to sleep the same amount every night as the average amount you slept from the 3rd to 6th days of the week. Write code to calculate how many hours of sleep per year someone who sleeps 8 hours a night gets. How many hours more/less than the 8 hours per night sleeper do you get in a year, assuming you sleep every night the average of the amount you slept on the first and last day of this week? What is your total sleep deficit for the last week? How many more hours per night, on average, do you need to sleep for the rest of the month so that, by the end of the month, you have a sleep deficit of zero? "],["calling_functions.html", "Module 9 Calling functions", " Module 9 Calling functions Learning goals Understand what functions are, and why they are awesome Understand how functions work Understand how to read function documentation   You have already worked with many R functions; commands like getwd(), length(), and unique() are all functions. You know a command is a function because it has parentheses, (), attached at its end. Just as variables are convenient names used for calling objects such as vectors or dataframes, functions are convenient names for calling processes or actions. An R function is just a batch of code that performs a certain action. Variables represent data, while functions represent code. Most functions have three key components: (1) one or more inputs, (2) a process that is applied to those inputs, and (3) an output of the result. When you call a function in R, you are saying, “Hey R, take this information, do something to it, and return the result to me.” You supply the function with the inputs, and the function takes care of the rest. Take the function mean(), for example. mean() finds the arithmetic mean (i.e., the average) of a set of values. x &lt;- c(4,6,3,2,6,8,5,3) # create a vector of numbers mean(x) # find their mean [1] 4.625 In this command, you are feeding the function mean() with the input x. Perhaps this analogy will help: When you think of functions, think of vending machines: you give a vending machine two inputs – your money and your snack selection – then it checks to see if your selection of choice is in stock, and if the money you provided is enough to pay for the snack you want. If so, the machine returns one output (the snack). Base functions in R There are hundreds of functions already built-in to R. These functions are called “base functions”. Throughout these modules, we have been – and will continue – introducing you to the most commonly used base functions. You can access other functions through bundles of external code known as packages, which we explain in an upcoming module. You can also write your own functions (and you will!). We provide an entire module on how to do this. Note that not all functions require an input. The function getwd(), for example, does not need anything in its parentheses to find and return current your working directory. Saving function output You will almost always want to save the result of a function in a new variable. Otherwise the function just prints its result to the Console and R forgets about it. You can store a function result the same way you store any value: x &lt;- c(4,6,3,2,6,8,5,3) x_mean &lt;- mean(x) x_mean [1] 4.625 Functions with multiple inputs Note that mean() accepts a second input that is called na.rm. This is short for NA.remove. When this is set to TRUE, R will remove broken or missing values from the vector before calculating the mean. x &lt;- c(4,6,3,2,NA,8,5,3) # note the NA mean(x,na.rm=TRUE) [1] 4.428571 If you tried to run these commands with na.rm set to FALSE, R would throw an error and give up. Note that you provided the function mean() with two inputs, x and na.rm, and that you separated each input with a comma. This is how you pass multiple inputs to a function. Function defaults Note that many functions have default values for their inputs. If you do not specify the input’s value yourself, R will assume you just want to use the default. In the case of mean(), the default value for na.rm is FALSE. This means that the following code would throw an error … x &lt;- c(4,6,3,2,NA,8,5,3) # note the NA mean(x) [1] NA Because R will assume you are using the default value for na.rm, which is FALSE, which means you do not want to remove missing values before trying to calculate the mean. Function documentation (i.e., getting help) Functions are designed to accept only a certain number of inputs with only certain names. To figure out what a function expects in terms of inputs, and what you can expect in terms of output, you can call up the function’s help page: When you enter this command, the help documentation for mean() will appear in the bottom right pane of your RStudio window: Learning how to read this documentation is essential to becoming competent in using R. Be warned: not all documentation is easy to understand! You will come to really resent poorly written documentation and really appreciate well-written documentation; the few extra minutes taken by the function’s author to write good documentation saves users around the world hours of frustration and confusion. The Title and Description help you understand what this function does. The Usage section shows you how type out the function. The Arguments section lists out each possible argument (which in R lingo is another word for input or parameter), explains what that input is asking for, and details any formatting requirements. The Value section describes what the function returns as output. At the bottom of the help page, example code is provided to show you how the function works. You can copy and paste this code into your own script of Console and check out the results. Note that more complex functions may also include a Details section in their documentation, which gives more explanation about what the function does, what kinds of inputs it requires, and what it returns. Function examples R comes with a set of base functions for descriptive statistics, which provide good examples of how functions work and why they are valuable. We can use the same vector as the input for all of these functions: x &lt;- c(4,6,3,2,NA,8,9,5,6,1,9,2,6,3,0,3,2,5,3,3) # note the NA mean() has been explained above. result &lt;- mean(x,na.rm=TRUE) result [1] 4.210526 median() returns the median value in the supplied vector: result &lt;- median(x,na.rm=TRUE) result [1] 3 sd() returns the standard deviation of the supplied vector: result &lt;- sd(x,na.rm=TRUE) result [1] 2.594416 summary() returns a vector that describes several aspects of the vector’s distribution: result &lt;- summary(x,na.rm=TRUE) result Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s 0.000 2.500 3.000 4.211 6.000 9.000 1 Exercises Sock survey You conducted a survey of your peers in this class, asking each of them how many pairs of socks they own. Most of your peers responded, but one person refused to tell you. Instead of giving you a number, they told you, “Nah!”. Your results look like this: # People you asked peers &lt;- c(&#39;Keri&#39;,&#39;Eric&#39;,&#39;Joe&#39;,&#39;Ben&#39;,&#39;Matthew&#39;,&#39;Jim&#39;) # Their responses socks &lt;- c(6,8,14,1,NA,4) 1. Calculate the average pairs of socks owned by your peers. 2. Calculate the total pairs of socks owned by cooperative students in this class. 3. Use code to find the name of the person who refused to tell you about their socks. 4. Use code to find the names of the people who were willing to cooperate with your survey. 5. Use code to find the name of the person with the most socks. 6. Use code to find the name of the person with the fewest socks.   Age survey 7. Create a vector named years with the years of birth of everyone in the room. 8. What is the average year of birth? 9. What is the median year of birth? 10. Create a vector called ages which is the (approximate) age of each person. 11. What is the minimum age? 12. What is the maximum age? 13. What is the median age? 14. What is the average age? 15. “Summarize” ages. 16. What is the range of ages? 17. What is the standard deviation of ages? 18. Look up help on the function sort(). 19. Created a vector called sorted_ages. It should be, well, sorted ages. 20. Look up the length() function. 21. How many people are the group? 22. Create an object called old. Assign to this object an age (such as 36) at which someone should be considered “old”. 23. Create an object called old_people. This should be a boolean/logical vector indicating if each person is old or not. 24. Is the seventh person in ages old? 25. How many years from being old or young is person 12?   Rolling the dice 26. Look up the help page for the function sample(). Here’s an example of how this function works. This line of code will sample a single random number from the vector 1:10. sample(1:10,size=1) [1] 10 This command will draw three random samples: sample(1:10,size=3) [1] 10 9 8 27. Use this function to simulate the rolling of a single die. 28. Now use this to simulate the rolling of a die 10 times. (Note: look at the replace input for sample().) 29. Now use this to roll the die 10,000 times, and assign the result to a new variable. (Note: look at the replace input for sample().) 30. Look up the help page for the function table(). 31. Use the table() function to ask whether the diel you rolled in question 29 is fair, or if it is weighted or biased toward a certain side. Can you describe what the table() function is doing? 30. Now use the sample() function to solve a different problem: your friends want to order take out from the Tavern, but no one in your group of 4 wants to be the one to go pick it up. Write code that will randomly select who has to go. "],["subsetting-filtering.html", "Module 10 Subsetting &amp; filtering Subsetting with indices Subsetting with booleans", " Module 10 Subsetting &amp; filtering Learning goals Understand how to subset / filter data   You have been introduce to subsetting and filtering briefly in previous modules, but it is such an important concept that we want to devote an entire module to practicing it. Subsetting with indices You have already learned that certain elements of a vector can be called by specifying an index: x &lt;- 55:65 # Call x without subsetting x [1] 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 # Now call only the third element of x x[3] [1] 57 Remember: brackets indicate that you don’t want everything from a vector; you just want certain elements. ‘I want x, but not all of it.’ You can also subset an object by calling multiple indices: # Now call the third, fourth, and fifth element of x x[c(3,4,5)] [1] 57 58 59 # Another way of doing the same thing: x[3:5] [1] 57 58 59 Subsetting with booleans You can also subset objects with ‘booleans’. This will eventually be your most common way of filtering data, by far. Recall that boolean / logical data have two possible values: TRUE or FALSE. For example: # Store Joe&#39;s age joes_age &lt;- 35 # Set the cutoff for old age old_age &lt;- 36 # Ask whether Joe is old joes_age &gt;= old_age [1] FALSE Recall also that you can calculate whether a condition is TRUE or FALSE on multiple elements of a vector. For example: # Build a vector of multiple ages ages &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60) # Set the cutoff for old age old_age &lt;- 36 # Ask which ages are considered old ages &gt;= old_age [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE Boolean vectors are super useful for subsetting. Think of ‘subsetting’ as keeping only those elements of a vector for which a condition is TRUE. x &lt;- 55:59 # Call x without subsetting x [1] 55 56 57 58 59 # Now subset to the second, third, and fourth element x[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)] [1] 56 57 58 That command returned elements for which the subetting vector was TRUE. This is equivalent to… x[2:4] [1] 56 57 58 You can also get the same result using a logical test, since logical tests return boolean values: # Develop your logical test: ask which values of x are in the vector 56:58 x %in% c(56,57,58) [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE # Now plug taht test it into the subsetting brackets x[ x %in% c(56,57,58) ] [1] 56 57 58 This methods gets really useful when you are working with bigger datasets, such as this one: # Make a large dataset of random numbers y &lt;- sample(1:1000,size=100) length(y) [1] 100 range(y) [1] 14 1000 With a dataset like this, you can use a boolean filter to figure out how many values are greater than, say, 90. First, develop your logical test, which will tell you whether each value in the vector is greater than 90: # Develop your logical test, y &gt; 90 [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE [13] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE [25] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE [37] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE [49] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE [61] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE [73] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE [85] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE [97] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE Now, to get the values corresponding to each TRUE in this list, plug your logical test into your subsetting brackets. y[y &gt; 90] [1] 374 534 252 687 188 279 633 891 897 643 870 585 218 391 565 [16] 851 706 399 894 879 542 371 668 935 653 198 699 693 213 593 [31] 682 421 814 419 899 547 130 326 165 869 607 275 320 881 354 [46] 499 1000 330 990 460 353 212 678 816 981 550 651 529 718 267 [61] 884 416 865 297 768 227 750 523 284 232 357 669 407 937 308 [76] 185 820 568 752 531 665 144 528 804 902 426 548 968 762 Here’s another way you can do the same thing: # Save the result of your logical test in a new vector verdicts &lt;- y &gt; 90 # Use that vector to subset y y[verdicts] [1] 374 534 252 687 188 279 633 891 897 643 870 585 218 391 565 [16] 851 706 399 894 879 542 371 668 935 653 198 699 693 213 593 [31] 682 421 814 419 899 547 130 326 165 869 607 275 320 881 354 [46] 499 1000 330 990 460 353 212 678 816 981 550 651 529 718 267 [61] 884 416 865 297 768 227 750 523 284 232 357 669 407 937 308 [76] 185 820 568 752 531 665 144 528 804 902 426 548 968 762 You can use double logical tests too.

But, as a data scientist, the most common data structure you will be working with – by far – is a dataframe. A dataframe, essentially, is a spreadsheet: a dataset with rows and columns, in which each column represents is a vector of the same class of data. Here is what a dataframe looks like: # Using one of R&#39;s built-in datasets head(iris) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa In this dataframe, each row pertains to a unique iris plant. The columns contain related information about each individual plant. Here’s another data.frame, built from scratch, which shows that dataframes are just a group of vectors: x &lt;- 25:29 y &lt;- 55:59 df &lt;- data.frame(x,y) df x y 1 25 55 2 26 56 3 27 57 4 28 58 5 29 59 In this command, we used the data.frame() function to combine two vectors into a dataframe with two columns named x and y. R then saved this result in a new variable named df. When we call df, R shows us the dataframe. The great thing about dataframes is that they allow you to relate different data types to each other. df &lt;- data.frame(name=c(&quot;Ben&quot;,&quot;Joe&quot;,&quot;Eric&quot;), height=c(75,73,80)) df name height 1 Ben 75 2 Joe 73 3 Eric 80 This dataframe has one column of class character and another of class numeric. Subsetting &amp; exploring dataframes To explore dataframes, let’s use a dataset on fuel mileage for all cars sold from 1985 to 2014. # need to install first install.packages(&#39;fueleconomy&#39;) library(fueleconomy) data(vehicles) head(vehicles) id make model year class trans 1 13309 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 Subcompact Cars Automatic 4-spd 2 13310 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 Subcompact Cars Manual 5-spd 3 13311 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 Subcompact Cars Automatic 4-spd 4 14038 Acura 2.3CL/3.0CL 1998 Subcompact Cars Automatic 4-spd 5 14039 Acura 2.3CL/3.0CL 1998 Subcompact Cars Manual 5-spd 6 14040 Acura 2.3CL/3.0CL 1998 Subcompact Cars Automatic 4-spd drive cyl displ fuel hwy cty 1 Front-Wheel Drive 4 2.2 Regular 26 20 2 Front-Wheel Drive 4 2.2 Regular 28 22 3 Front-Wheel Drive 6 3.0 Regular 26 18 4 Front-Wheel Drive 4 2.3 Regular 27 19 5 Front-Wheel Drive 4 2.3 Regular 29 21 6 Front-Wheel Drive 6 3.0 Regular 26 17 To look at this dataframe in full, you call display it in a separate tab within RStudio using the View() function: View(vehicles) A dataframe has rows of data organized into columns. In this dataframe, each row pertains to a single vehicle make/model – i.e., a single observation. Each column pertains to a single type of data. Columns are named in the header of the dataframe. All the same useful exploration and subsetting functions that applied to vectors now apply to dataframes. In addition to those functions you already know, let’s add some new functions to your inventory of useful functions. Exploration head() and tail() summarize the beginning and end of the object: head(vehicles) id make model year class trans 1 13309 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 Subcompact Cars Automatic 4-spd 2 13310 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 Subcompact Cars Manual 5-spd 3 13311 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 Subcompact Cars Automatic 4-spd 4 14038 Acura 2.3CL/3.0CL 1998 Subcompact Cars Automatic 4-spd 5 14039 Acura 2.3CL/3.0CL 1998 Subcompact Cars Manual 5-spd 6 14040 Acura 2.3CL/3.0CL 1998 Subcompact Cars Automatic 4-spd drive cyl displ fuel hwy cty 1 Front-Wheel Drive 4 2.2 Regular 26 20 2 Front-Wheel Drive 4 2.2 Regular 28 22 3 Front-Wheel Drive 6 3.0 Regular 26 18 4 Front-Wheel Drive 4 2.3 Regular 27 19 5 Front-Wheel Drive 4 2.3 Regular 29 21 6 Front-Wheel Drive 6 3.0 Regular 26 17 tail(vehicles) id make model year class trans 33437 28868 Yugo GV Plus/GV/Cabrio 1990 Minicompact Cars Manual 4-spd 33438 6635 Yugo GV Plus/GV/Cabrio 1990 Subcompact Cars Manual 5-spd 33439 3157 Yugo GV/GVX 1987 Subcompact Cars Manual 4-spd 33440 5497 Yugo GV/GVX 1989 Subcompact Cars Manual 4-spd 33441 5498 Yugo GV/GVX 1989 Subcompact Cars Manual 5-spd 33442 1745 Yugo Gy/yugo GVX 1986 Minicompact Cars Manual 4-spd drive cyl displ fuel hwy cty 33437 Front-Wheel Drive 4 1.3 Regular 27 21 33438 Front-Wheel Drive 4 1.3 Regular 28 23 33439 Front-Wheel Drive 4 1.1 Regular 29 24 33440 Front-Wheel Drive 4 1.1 Regular 29 24 33441 Front-Wheel Drive 4 1.3 Regular 28 23 33442 Front-Wheel Drive 4 1.1 Regular 29 22 names() tells you the column names: names(vehicles) [1] &quot;id&quot; &quot;make&quot; &quot;model&quot; &quot;year&quot; &quot;class&quot; &quot;trans&quot; &quot;drive&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;displ&quot; [10] &quot;fuel&quot; &quot;hwy&quot; &quot;cty&quot; nrow(), ncol(), and dim() tell you about the dimensions of your dataframe: nrow(vehicles) [1] 33442 ncol(vehicles) [1] 12 dim(vehicles) [1] 33442 12 Note that length() does not work the same on dataframes as it does with vectors. In dataframes, length() is the equivalent of ncol(); it will not give you the number of rows in a dataset. Importantly, you can use is.na() to ask whether columns or rows contain NAs: # Check for NAs # Which rows in the `hwy` column have NA&#39;s? which(is.na(vehicles$hwy)) integer(0) # (No NAs in that column!) # What about rows in the `cyl` column? which(is.na(vehicles$cyl)) [1] 1232 1233 2347 3246 3247 3248 6115 6116 6533 7783 7784 8472 [13] 10613 10614 11696 11697 12411 12412 12413 12928 12929 12934 12935 12944 [25] 16429 16430 21070 23472 23473 23474 24485 24486 24487 24488 24489 26150 [37] 28628 28704 28705 28706 28707 28708 28709 29314 29315 30023 30024 30025 [49] 30026 30027 30028 31063 31064 31065 31066 31067 31068 31069 # (lots of NAs in that column!) Subsetting Recall that dataframes are filtered by row and/or column using this format: dataframe[rows,columns]. To get the third element of the second column, for example, you type dataframe[3,2]. vehicles[3,2] [1] &quot;Acura&quot; Note that the comma is necessary even if you do not want to specify columns. If you try to type this … vehicles[3] …R will assume you are asking for the third column, not the third row. To filter a dataframe to multiple values, you can specify vectors for the row and column vehicles[1:3,11:12] # can use colons hwy cty 1 26 20 2 28 22 3 26 18 vehicles[1:3,c(1,11:12)] # can use c() id hwy cty 1 13309 26 20 2 13310 28 22 3 13311 26 18 Columns can also be called according to their names. Use the $ sign to specify a column. vehicles$hwy[1:5] [1] 26 28 26 27 29 Note that when you use a $, you will not need to use a comma within your brackets. If you try to run this … vehicles$hwy[1:5,] …R will throw a fit. Also recall that you can use logical tests, which return boolean values TRUE or FALSE, to filter dataframes to rows that meet certain conditions. For example, to filter to only the rows for cars with better than 100 mpg, you can use this syntax: # Build your logical test verdicts &lt;- vehicles$hwy &gt; 100 # Subset with booleans vehicles[verdicts,2:3] make model 6533 Chevrolet Spark EV 10613 Fiat 500e 10614 Fiat 500e 16429 Honda Fit EV 16430 Honda Fit EV 24487 Nissan Leaf 24488 Nissan Leaf 24489 Nissan Leaf 28628 Scion iQ EV Or you can write all this in a single line, to be more efficient: vehicles[ vehicles$hwy &gt; 100 , 2:3] make model 6533 Chevrolet Spark EV 10613 Fiat 500e 10614 Fiat 500e 16429 Honda Fit EV 16430 Honda Fit EV 24487 Nissan Leaf 24488 Nissan Leaf 24489 Nissan Leaf 28628 Scion iQ EV Recall that the logical test is returning a bunch of TRUE’s and FALSE’s, one for each row of vehicles. Only the TRUE rows will be returned. Summarizing The same summary functions that you have used for vectors work for the columns in dataframes, since each column is also a vector. Check it out: min(vehicles$hwy) [1] 9 max(vehicles$hwy) [1] 109 mean(vehicles$cty) [1] 17.491 sd(vehicles$cty) [1] 5.582174 str(vehicles$make) chr [1:33442] &quot;Acura&quot; &quot;Acura&quot; &quot;Acura&quot; &quot;Acura&quot; &quot;Acura&quot; &quot;Acura&quot; &quot;Acura&quot; ... class(vehicles$hwy) [1] &quot;numeric&quot; You can also use the summary() function, which provides summary statistics for each column in your dataframe: summary(vehicles) id make model year Min. : 1 Length:33442 Length:33442 Min. :1984 1st Qu.: 8361 Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.:1991 Median :16724 Mode :character Mode :character Median :1999 Mean :17038 Mean :1999 3rd Qu.:25265 3rd Qu.:2008 Max. :34932 Max. :2015 class trans drive cyl Length:33442 Length:33442 Length:33442 Min. : 2.000 Class :character Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.: 4.000 Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Median : 6.000 Mean : 5.772 3rd Qu.: 6.000 Max. :16.000 NA&#39;s :58 displ fuel hwy cty Min. :0.000 Length:33442 Min. : 9.00 Min. : 6.00 1st Qu.:2.300 Class :character 1st Qu.: 19.00 1st Qu.: 15.00 Median :3.000 Mode :character Median : 23.00 Median : 17.00 Mean :3.353 Mean : 23.55 Mean : 17.49 3rd Qu.:4.300 3rd Qu.: 27.00 3rd Qu.: 20.00 Max. :8.400 Max. :109.00 Max. :138.00 NA&#39;s :57 The function unique() returns unique values within a column: unique(vehicles$fuel) [1] &quot;Regular&quot; &quot;Premium&quot; [3] &quot;Diesel&quot; &quot;Premium or E85&quot; [5] &quot;Electricity&quot; &quot;Gasoline or E85&quot; [7] &quot;Premium Gas or Electricity&quot; &quot;Gasoline or natural gas&quot; [9] &quot;CNG&quot; &quot;Midgrade&quot; [11] &quot;Regular Gas and Electricity&quot; &quot;Gasoline or propane&quot; [13] &quot;Premium and Electricity&quot; Finally, the order() function helps you sort a dataframe according to the values in one of its columns. # Sort dataframe by highway mileage # Only keep certain columns vehicles_sorted &lt;- vehicles[order(vehicles$hwy), c(2,3,4,10:12)] head(vehicles_sorted) make model year fuel hwy cty 397 Aston Martin Lagonda 1985 Regular 9 7 398 Aston Martin Lagonda 1985 Regular 9 7 406 Aston Martin Saloon/Vantage/Volante 1985 Regular 9 7 408 Aston Martin Saloon/Vantage/Volante 1985 Regular 9 7 27725 Rolls-Royce Camargue 1987 Regular 9 7 27726 Rolls-Royce Continental 1987 Regular 9 7 Reverse the order by wrapping rev() around the order() call: vehicles_sorted &lt;- vehicles[rev(order(vehicles$hwy)), c(2,3,4,10:12)] head(vehicles_sorted) make model year fuel hwy cty 6533 Chevrolet Spark EV 2014 Electricity 109 128 10614 Fiat 500e 2014 Electricity 108 122 10613 Fiat 500e 2013 Electricity 108 122 28628 Scion iQ EV 2013 Electricity 105 138 16430 Honda Fit EV 2014 Electricity 105 132 16429 Honda Fit EV 2013 Electricity 105 132 Creating dataframes As shown above, to create a new dataframe, use the data.frame() function. car mgp_hwy mpg_city 100 Acura Legend 23 15 101 Acura Legend 22 17 102 Acura Legend 23 16 103 Acura Legend 21 16 104 Acura Legend 22 17 105 Acura Legend 23 16 106 Acura Legend 24 16 Note how the columns were named in the data.frame() call, and that each column is separated by a comma. You can also stage an empty dataframe, which sounds useless but will become very useful as you start working with for loops and other higher-order R tools. df &lt;- data.frame() df data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows To coerce an object into a format that R interprets as a dataframe, use as.dataframe(): df &lt;- as.data.frame(vehicles) df[1:4,1:4] id make model year 1 13309 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 2 13310 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 3 13311 Acura 2.2CL/3.0CL 1997 4 14038 Acura 2.3CL/3.0CL 1998 Modifying dataframes Combining dataframes To bind multiple dataframes together by row, use rbind(): # Build up a dataframe df1 &lt;- data.frame(name=c(&quot;Ben&quot;,&quot;Joe&quot;,&quot;Eric&quot;,&quot;Isabelle&quot;), instrument=c(&quot;Nose harp&quot;,&quot;Concertina&quot;,&quot;Ukelele&quot;,&quot;Drums&quot;)) df1 name instrument 1 Ben Nose harp 2 Joe Concertina 3 Eric Ukelele 4 Isabelle Drums # Build up a second dataframe df2 &lt;- data.frame(name=c(&quot;Matthew&quot;), instrument=c(&quot;Washboard&quot;)) # Combine those dataframes together rbind(df1,df2) name instrument 1 Ben Nose harp 2 Joe Concertina 3 Eric Ukelele 4 Isabelle Drums 5 Matthew Washboard Note that to be combined, two dataframes have to have the exact same number of columns and the exact same column names.

Subset one field according to a logical test: With no more than two lines of code, get the number of Honda cars in the vehicles dataset. 6. Subset one field according to a logical test for a different field: In a single line of code, show the mileages of all the Toyotas in the dataset. 7. Subset a dataframe to a single subgroup: In a single line of code, determine how many differet car makes/models were produced in 1995. 8. Get the mean value for a subgroup of data: What is the average city mileage for Subaru cars in the dataset? 9. Subset a dataframe to only data from between two values: According to this dataset, how many different car makes/models have been produced with highway mileages between 30 and 40 mpg? 10. Subset by removing NAs: Create a new version of the vehicles dataframe that does not have any NAs in the trans column.   Creating dataframes 11. Create a vector called people of 5 peoples names from the class. 12. Show with code how many people are in your vector 13. Create another vector called height which is the number of centimeters tall each of those 5 people are. 14. Combine these two vectors into a data frame. Now let’s create a new object named animals. This is going to be a dataframe with 4 different columns: species, weight (in kg), color, veg (whether or not the animal is a vegetarian / herbivore). 15. Come up with five species to add to your dataframe and list them in a vector named species. 16. Make the other vectors with details about those species in the correct order. 17. Combine these vectors into a dataframe named animals.   Altering dataframes 18. Add a column to your animals dataframe named rank, which ranks each animal from your least favorite (0) to your most favorite (5). 19. Now write code to manually switch the ranking for your top two favorite animals. 20. What is the mean weight of the herbivorous animals that you listed, if any? 21. What is the mean weight of the omnivorous/carnivorous animals that you listed?

You can also write your own functions, which we will cover in an upcoming module. You can also access thousands of other functions and datasets through bundles of external code known as packages. Packages are developed and shared by R users around the world – a global community working together to increase R’s versatility and impact. Some packages are designed to be broadly useful for almost any application, such as the packages you will be learning in this course (ggplot, dplyr, stringr, etc.). Such packages make it easier and more efficient to do your work with R. Others are designed for niche problems that can be made much more doable with specialized functions or datasets. For example, the package PBSmapping contains shoreline, seafloor, and oceanographic datasets and custom mapping functions that make it easier for marine scientists at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in British Columbia, Canada, to carry out their work. Packages you already have In RStudio, look to the pane in the bottom right and click on the Packages tab. You should see something like this: This is displaying all the packages already installed in your system. If you click on one of these packages (try the base package, for example), you will be taken to a list of all the functions and datasets contained within it. When you click on one of these functions, you will be taken to the help page for that function. This is the equivalent of typing ? &lt;function_name&gt; into the Console. Installing a new package There are a couple ways to download and install a new R package on your computer. Most packages are available from an open-source repository known as CRAN (which stands for Comprehensive R Archive Network). However, an increasingly common practice is to release packages on a public repository such as GitHub. Installing from CRAN You can install CRAN packages one of two ways: Through clicks: In RStudio, in the bottom-right pane, return to the Packages tab. Click on the “Install” button. You can then search for the package you wish to install then click Install. Through code: You can download packages from the Console using the install.packages() function. install.packages(&#39;fun&#39;) Note that the package name must be in quotation marks. Installing from GitHub To install packages from GitHub, you must first download a CRAN package that makes it easy to do so: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) Most packages on GitHub include instructions for downloading it on its GitHub page. For example, visit this GitHub page to see the documentation for the package wesanderson, which provides color palette themes based upon Wes Anderson’s films. On this site, scroll down and you will find instructions for downloading the package. These instructions show you how to install this package from your R Console: devtools::install_github(&quot;karthik/wesanderson&quot;) Now go to your Packages tab in the bottom-right pane of RStudio, scroll down to find the wesanderson package, and click on it to check out its functions. Loading an installed package There is a difference between installed and loaded packages. Go back to your Packages tab. Notice that some of the packages have a checked box next to their names, while others don’t. These checked boxes indicate which packages are currently loaded. All packages in the list are installed on your computer, but only the checked packages are loaded, i.e., ready for use. To load a package, use the library() function. library(fun) library(wesanderson) Now that your new packages are loaded, you can actually use their functions. To emphasize: a package is installed only once, but you library() the package in each and every script that uses it. Think of a package as camping gear. Like an R package, camping gear helps you do cool things that you can’t really do with the regular stuff in your closet. And, like an R package, you only need to install (i.e., purchase) your gear once; but it is useless unless you pack it in your car (i.e., library() it) every time you go on a trip. Calling functions from a package Most functions from external packages can be used by simply typing the name of the function. For example, the package fun contains a function for generating a random password: random_password(length=24) [1] &quot;cOIyr1Wv&amp;}%|#!Jk3X{,NDR6&quot; Sometimes, however, R can get confused if a new package contains a function that has the same name of some function from a different package. If R seems confused about a function you are calling, it can help to specify which package the function can be found in. This is done using the syntax &lt;package_name&gt;::&lt;function_name&gt;. For example, the following command is a fine alternative to the command above: fun::random_password(length=24) [1] &quot;\\&quot;5wo}RnpA!ts=,MjIlODQ|xG&quot; Note that this was done in the example above using the devtools package. Side notes Package dependencies Most packages contain functions that are built using functions built from other packages. Those new functions depend on the functions from those other packages, and that’s why those other packages are known as dependencies. When you install one function, you will notice that R typically has to install several other packages at the same time; these are the dependencies that allow the package of interest to function. Package versions Packages are updated regularly, and sometimes new versions can break the functions that use it as a dependency. Sometimes you may have to install a new version (or sometimes an older version!) of a dependency in order to get your package of interest to work as desired. Review: the workflow for using a package To review how to use functions from a non-base package in R, follow these steps (examples provided:) Install the package once. # Example from CRAN install.packages(&quot;wesanderson&quot;) # Example from GitHub devtools::install_github(&quot;karthik/wesanderson&quot;) Load the package in each script. # Example library(wesanderson) Call the function. wes_palette(&quot;Royal1&quot;) wesanderson::wes_palette(&quot;Zissou1&quot;) (This function creates a plot displaying the different colors contained within the specified palette.)

This is called reading in your data. Reading in data The general workflow for reading in data is as follows: In RStudio, set your working directory. Place your data file in your working directory. (See the section below if you want to keep your data somewhere else.) In your R script, read in your data file with one of the core functions below. You can use this simple data file, super_data.csv, to practice. Core functions for reading data To become agile in reading various types of data into R, here are five key functions you should know: readr::read_csv() Reading in data is simple and easy if your data are saved as a .csv, a comma-separated file. You can find functions for reading all sorts of file types into R, but the quickest way to begin working with your own data in R is to maintain that data in .csv’s. The function read_csv(), from a package named readr, becomes useful when you begin working with (1) data from the internet, (2) data within the tidyverse, which you will be introduced to in the next module, and/or (2) very large dataset, since it reads data much more quickly and provides progress updates along the way. Here’s an example of reading a file directly from the internet … library(readr) df &lt;- read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrew/intro-to-data-science/main/data/deaths.csv&#39;) df # A tibble: 891 × 12 PassengerId Survived Pclass Name Sex Age SibSp Parch Ticket Fare Cabin &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 0 3 Braun… male 22 1 0 A/5 2… 7.25 &lt;NA&gt; 2 2 1 1 Cumin… fema… 38 1 0 PC 17… 71.3 C85 3 3 1 3 Heikk… fema… 26 0 0 STON/… 7.92 &lt;NA&gt; 4 4 1 1 Futre… fema… 35 1 0 113803 53.1 C123 5 5 0 3 Allen… male 35 0 0 373450 8.05 &lt;NA&gt; 6 6 0 3 Moran… male NA 0 0 330877 8.46 &lt;NA&gt; 7 7 0 1 McCar… male 54 0 0 17463 51.9 E46 8 8 0 3 Palss… male 2 3 1 349909 21.1 &lt;NA&gt; 9 9 1 3 Johns… fema… 27 0 2 347742 11.1 &lt;NA&gt; 10 10 1 2 Nasse… fema… 14 1 0 237736 30.1 &lt;NA&gt; # ℹ 881 more rows # ℹ 1 more variable: Embarked &lt;chr&gt; Note that when you use read_csv() instead of read.csv(), your data are read in as a tibble instead of a dataframe. You will be introduced to tibbles in the next modules on dataframes; for the time being, think of a tibble as a fancy version of a dataframe that can be treated exactly as a regular dataframe. read.csv() This function, read.csv(), is the base function for reading in a .csv. It is strictly used for reading in local files (not from the internet). This function reads in your data file as a dataframe. Save your dataset into R’s memory using a variable (in this case, df). df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/super_data.csv&quot;) df patient_id height_in weight_lb comment 1 1 74 135 not very nice 2 2 56 112 kinda cute 3 3 59 156 kinda cute but had a ring 4 4 43 102 so small! The read.csv() function has plenty of other inputs in the event that your data file is unable to follow the formatting rules outlined above (see ?read.csv()). The three most common inputs you may want to use are header, skip, and stringsAsFactors. Use the header input when your data does not contain column names. For example, header=FALSE indicates that your datafile does not have any column names. Use the skip input when you want to skip some lines of metadata at the top of your file. This is handy if you really don’t want to get rid of your metadata in your header. For example, skip=2 skips the first two rows of the datafile before R begins reading data. Use the stringsAsFactors input when you want to make absolutely sure that R interprets any non-numeric fields as characters rather than factors. We have not focused on factors yet, but it can be frustrating when R mistakes a column of character strings as a column factors. To avoid any possible confusion, use stringsAsFactors=TRUE as an input. For example, here is how to read in this data without column names: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/super_data.csv&quot;,skip=1,header=FALSE) df V1 V2 V3 V4 1 1 74 135 not very nice 2 2 56 112 kinda cute 3 3 59 156 kinda cute but had a ring 4 4 43 102 so small! If you do this without setting header to FALSE, your first row of data gets used as column names and it becomes a big ole mess: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/super_data.csv&quot;,skip=1) df X1 X74 X135 not.very.nice 1 2 56 112 kinda cute 2 3 59 156 kinda cute but had a ring 3 4 43 102 so small! readxl() To read in an Excel spreadsheet, use the read_xlsx() function from the package readxl. If super_data were an .xlsx file, the command would look like this: library(readxl) df &lt;- read_xlsx(&quot;data/super_data.xlsx&quot;,sheet=1) gsheet() To read in an GoogleSheets spreadsheet, use the gsheet2tbl() function from the package gsheet. Make sure link sharing is turned on for the GoogleSheet you are trying to access: library(gsheet) df &lt;- gsheet2tbl(&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uQ5PfGITnjHngK41FWHeedioca30wpyEsBOpC_B6T3E/edit?usp=sharing&quot;) df # A tibble: 4 × 4 patient_id height_in weight_lb comment &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 74 135 not very nice 2 2 56 112 kinda cute 3 3 59 156 kinda cute but had a ring 4 4 43 102 so small readRDS() Another niche function for reading data is readRDS(). This function allows you to read in R data objects, which have the file extension .rds. These data objects need not be in the same format as a .csv or even a dataframe, and that is what makes them so handy. A colleague could send you an .rds object of a vector, a list, a plotting function, or any other kind of R object, and you can read it in with readRDS(). For example, super_data.rdscontains a tibble version of the dataframe above. When you read in that .rds file, it is already formatted as a tibble: df &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/super_data.rds&quot;) df # A tibble: 4 × 4 patient_id height_in weight_lb comment &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 74 135 not very nice 2 2 56 112 kinda cute 3 3 59 156 kinda cute but had a ring 4 4 43 102 so small! .csv files The .csv is such an important file type when you work with data that it is worth introducing it with more detail. When you preview a .csv, it looks something like this: A neat spreadsheet of rows and columns. When you open up this same dataset in a simple text editor, it looks like this: This looks scary, but it is actually really simple. A .csv is a simple text file in which each row is on a new line and columns of data are separated by commas. As a simple text file, there is no fancy formatting. There are no “Sheets” or “Tabs”, as you would find in GoogleSheets or Excel; it is a simple ‘flat’ file. One of the major advantages of working with .csv’s is that the format is cross-platform and non-proprietary. That is, they work on Windows, Mac, Linux, and any other common type of computer, and they do not require special software to open. Prepping your data for R For those of us used to working in Excel, GoogleSheets, or Numbers, it will take some adjustment to get into the habit of formatting your data for R. We are used to seeing spreadsheets that look something like this: To read a .csv into R without issues or fancy code, this spreadsheet will need to be simplified to look like this: Workflow for formatting your data Below is the general worfklow for preparing your data for R is the following: 1. Get your data into .csv format. In Excel and Numbers, you can use ‘Save As’ to change the file format. In GoogleSheets, you can ‘Download As’ a .csv. This will remove any colors, thick lines, special fonts, bold or italicized font styles, and any other special formatting. All that will be left is your data, and that’s the way R likes it. 2. Remove blank columns before and in the middle of your data. 3. Remove fancy elements such as graphs. 4. Simplify your ‘header’. The space above your data is your spreadsheet’s header. It includes column names and metadata like title, author, measurement units, etc. It is possible to read data with complex headers into R, but again we are going for simplicity here, so we suggest (1) simplifying your header to contain column names only, and (2) moving metadata to a README.txt file that lives in the same folder as your data. 5. Simplify column names. Remove spaces, or replace them with ., - or _. Make your column names as simple and brief as possible while still being informative. Include units in the column names, as in the screenshot above. Be sure that each column has a name. 6. Remove all commas and hashtags from your dataset. You can do this with the ‘Find &amp; Replace’ feature built-into in most spreadsheet editors. Managing files &amp; folders Reading data from other folders The data-reading functions above require only a single input: the path to your data file. This path is relative to the location of your working directory. When your data file is inside your working directory, the path simplifies to be the same as the filename of your data: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/super_data.csv&quot;) Sometimes, though, you will want to keep your data somewhere nearby but not necessarily within your working directory. Consider the following scenario, in which three versions of the “super_data.csv” dataset occur near a working directory being used for this module: We have a version within the same directory as our R file (i.e., our working directory), another version within a child folder within the directory (i.e., a subfolder), and another version in the parent folder of the working directory. To read a file from a child folder, add the prefix, ./&lt;child name&gt;/, to your command: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/super_data.csv&quot;) To read a file from a parent folder, add the prefix, ../, to your command: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/super_data.csv&quot;) Managing files Now consider the following scenario, in which your project folder structure looks like this: This structure can be a effective and simple way of organizing your files for a project, and we recommend using it. Here’s what these child folders should contain. ./data/ contains data, of course. ./doc/ contains documents, such as manuscript drafts. ./figures/ contains files for graphs and figures. ./R/ contains R scripts, of course. ./references/ contains journal articles and other resources you are using in your research. Since your R code is going into the R child folder, that is what you should set your working directory for those R scripts to. In that case, how to read data from the data folder, which is a separate child folder of your parent folder? Here’s how: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;../data/super_data.csv&quot;) "],["base-plots.html", "Module 14 Base plots Create a basic plot Most common types of plots Basic plot formatting Plotting with data frames", " Module 14 Base plots Learning goals Make basic plots in R Basic adjustments to plot formatting   To learn how to plot, let’s first create a dataset to work with: country &lt;- c(&quot;USA&quot;,&quot;Tanzania&quot;,&quot;Japan&quot;,&quot;Ctr. Africa Rep.&quot;,&quot;China&quot;,&quot;Norway&quot;,&quot;India&quot;) lifespan &lt;- c(79,65,84,53,77,82,69) gdp &lt;- c(55335,2875,38674,623,13102,84500,6807) These data come from this publicly available database that compares health and economic indices across countries in 2011. The lifespan column presents the average life expectancy for each country. The gdp column presents the average GDP per capita within that country, which is a common index for the income and wealth of average citizens. Let’s see if there is a relationship between life expectancy and income. Create a basic plot The simplest way to make a basic plot in R is to use its built-in plot() function: plot(lifespan ~ gdp) This syntax is saying this: plot column lifespan as a function of gdp. The symbol ~ denotes “as a function of”. This frames lifespan as a dependent variable (y axis) that is affected by the independent variable (x axis), which in this case is gdp. Note that R uses the variable names you provided as the x- and y-axes. You can adjust these labels however you wish (see formatting section below). You can also produce this exact same plot using the following syntax: plot(y=lifespan, x=gdp) Choose whichever one is most intuitive to you. Most common types of plots The plot above is a scatter plot, and is one of the most common types of plots in data science. You can turn this into a line plot by adding a parameter to the plot() function: plot(lifespan ~ gdp, type=&quot;l&quot;) What a mess! Rather than connecting these values in the order you might expect, R connects them in the order that they are listed in their source vectors. This is why line plots tend to be more useful in scenarios such as time series, which are inherently ordered. Another common plot is the bar plot, which uses a different R function: barplot(height=lifespan,names.arg=country) In this command, the parameter height determines the height of the bars, and names.arg provides the labels to place beneath each bar. There are many more plot types out there, but let’s stop here for now. Basic plot formatting You can adjust the default formatting of plots by adding other inputs to your plot() command. To understand all the parameters you can adjust, bring up the help page for this function: ?plot If multiple help page options are returned, select the Generiz X-Y Plotting page from the base package. This is the plot function that comes built-in to R. Here we demonstrate just a few of the most common formatting adjustments you are likely to use: Set plot range using xlim (for the x axis) and ylim (for the y axis): plot(lifespan ~ gdp,xlim=c(0,60000),ylim=c(40,100)) In this command, you are defining axis limits using a 2-element vector (i.e., c(min,max)). Note that it can be easier to read your code if you put each input on a new line, like this: plot(lifespan ~ gdp, xlim=c(0,60000), ylim=c(40,100)) Make sure each input line within the function ends with a comma, otherwise you R will get confused and throw an error. Set dot type using the input pch: plot(lifespan ~ gdp,pch=16) Set dot color using the input col (the default is col=\"black\") plot(lifespan ~ gdp,col=&quot;red&quot;) Here is a great resource for color names in R. Set dot size using the input cex (the default is cex=1): plot(lifespan ~ gdp,cex=3) Set axis labels using the inputs xlab and ylab: plot(lifespan ~ gdp, xlab=&quot;Gross Domestic Product (GDP)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) Set axis number size using the input cex.axis (the default is cex.axis=1): plot(lifespan ~ gdp,cex.axis=.5) Set axis label size using the input cex.label (the default is cex.lab=1): plot(lifespan ~ gdp,cex.lab=.5) Set plot margins using the function par(mar=c()) before you call plot(): par(mar=c(5,5,0.5,0.5)) plot(lifespan ~ gdp) In this command, the four numbers in the vector used to define mar correspond to the margin for the bottom, left, top, and right sides of the plot, respectively. Create a multi-pane plot using the function par(mfrow=c()) before you call plot(): par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(lifespan ~ gdp,col=&quot;red&quot;,pch=16) plot(lifespan ~ gdp,col=&quot;blue&quot;,pch=16) In this command, the two numbers in the vector used to define mfrow correspond to the number of rows and columns, respectively, on the entire plot. In this case, you have 1 row of plots with two columns. Note that you will need to reset the number of panes when you are done with your multi-pane plot! par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Plot dots and lines at once using the input type: par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(lifespan ~ gdp,type=&quot;b&quot;) plot(lifespan ~ gdp,type=&quot;o&quot;) par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Note the two slightly different formats here. Use a logarithmic scale for one or of your axes using the input log plot(lifespan ~ gdp,log=&quot;x&quot;) Plotting with data frames So far in this tutorial we have been using vectors to produce plots. This is nice for learning, but does not represent the real world very well. You will almost always be producing plots using dataframes. Let’s turn these vectors into a dataframe: df &lt;- data.frame(country,lifespan,gdp) df country lifespan gdp 1 USA 79 55335 2 Tanzania 65 2875 3 Japan 84 38674 4 Ctr. Africa Rep. 53 623 5 China 77 13102 6 Norway 82 84500 7 India 69 6807 To plot data within a dataframe, your plot() syntax changes slightly: plot(lifespan ~ gdp, data=df) This syntax is saying this: using the dataframe named df as a source, plot column lifespan as a function of column gdp. The symbol ~ denotes “as a function of”. This frames lifespan as a dependent variable (y axis) that is affected by the independent variable (x axis), which in this case is gdp. Another way to write this command is as follows: plot(df$lifespan ~ df$gdp) In this command, as you learned in the dataframes module, the $ symbol is saying, “give me the column in df named lifespan”. It is a handy way of referring to a column within a dataframe by name. Exercises The economics of health 1. Using the data above, produce a bar plot that shows the GDP for each country. 2. Use the df dataframe you built above to produce a bar plot that shows life expectancy for each country. 3. Use the df dataframe to produce a jumbled line plot of life expectancy as a function of GDP. Reference the plot() documentation to figure out how to change the thickness of the line.   Shoe ~ height correlation 4. Create a vector of the names of 5 people who are sitting near you. Call it people. 5. Create a vector of those same 5 people’s shoe sizes (in the same order!). Call it shoe_size. 6. Create another vector of those same 5 people’s height. Call it height. 7. Create another vector of those same 5 people’s sex. Call it sex. 8. Make a scatterplot of height and shoe size. Is there a correlation? 9. Look up help for boxplot. Make a boxplot. 10. Make a dataframe named df. It should contain columns of all the vectors created so far. 11. Make a side by side boxplot with shoe sizes of males vs females. 12. Try to find documentation for making a “histogram” (hint: use text autocomplete). 13. Make a histogram of people’s height.   Make your plot beautiful 14.

Scatter plot Bar plot", " Module 15 ggplot Learning goals Understand what ggplot2 is and why it’s used Be able to think conceptually in the framework of the “grammar of graphics” Learn the basic syntax for creating different plots using using ggplot2 What is ggplot2? ggplot2 is an R package. It’s one of the most downloaded packages in the R universe, and has become the gold standard for data visualization. It’s extremely powerful and flexible, and allows for creating lots of visualizations of different types, ranging from maps to bare-bones academic publications, to complex, paneled charts with labeling, etc. Because the syntax is so different from “base” R, it can give the impression of having a somewhat steep learning curve. But in reality, because the principles are so conceptually simple, learning is fairly fast. Generally those who choose to learn it stick with it; that is, once you go gg, you don’t go back. Note: we will refer heavily to this online guide about ggplot The name &amp; concept Error in file(filename, &quot;r&quot;, encoding = encoding): cannot open the connection Error in teacher_tip(tip): could not find function &quot;teacher_tip&quot; The “gg” in ggplot stands for “grammar of graphics”, with “grammar” meaning “the fundamental principles or rules of an art or science” [@layered-grammar]. Just as all languages share common principles of grammar and syntax, so too do the many forms of data visualization. The basic idea is that all graphs can be described using a layered grammar: all graphs represent a dataset using the same layers of visual order. Plots are made of layers. Think of how you draw a plot from scratch: First, you get a piece of paper – a canvas. Second, you draw the x axis and y axis: each direction on your canvas represents the range of a set of data. This establishes a landscape of coordinates. Third, the data need to be placed somewhere in that landscape. You map the data to the coordinates. Fourth, when you actually draw the data at their prescribed locations on the plot, you have to decide how to do so. You use geometric objects – like points, lines, and bars – and other aesthetic attributes – like colors, line thicknesses, and dot size. Fifth, you add labels – such as axis titles, an overhead title, or a legend – to help the viewer understand the plot. You now have a basic plot. But sometimes you will add additional layers: Sixth, you may add statistical summaries – such as regression lines or standard error bars. Seventh, you may decide to do an overhaul and split your plot into several facets, in which subgroups of the data are plotted separately to produce a multi-panel plot. Finally, in the final layer, you may decide to stylize the entire plot to fit a visual theme, such as the trademark styles of vendors like the The Economist or The New York Times. When you produce a plot with ggplot, you will mirror this same process step-by-step. This is why you will often see the process underlying ggplot described using a graphic like this:   Note: If you want to learn more about the theory, the most well-known “grammar of graphics” was written in 2005 and laid out some abstract principles for describing statistical graphics [@10.5555/1088896]. Setting up ggplot Let’s learn by doing. First, install and load ggplot2 and associated packages. library(ggplot2) library(readr) library(ggthemes) library(dplyr) Download the titanic dataset, the manifest of Titanic passengers with details such as as age, passenger class, fare paid, and whether or not they survived. titanic&lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrew/intro-to-data-science/main/data/deaths.csv&quot;) Error in file(filename, &quot;r&quot;, encoding = encoding): cannot open the connection Error in teacher_tip(tip): could not find function &quot;teacher_tip&quot; Scatter plot Say you want to explore the relationship between passengers’ age and the fare they paid to travel aboard the Titanic. Set up our canvas. If we just type ggplot() without anything in the parentheses, the function will just return a blank piece of paper. ggplot() Draw the axes and, 3., setup our landscape of coordinates. To do so, we need to feed ggplot() some data and tell it which columns should be mapped onto the axes. ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Age, y = Fare)) That code looks a bit clunky, we know. The aes() input, which is short for aesthetics, is actually a function. Everything included in its parentheses will be used to map your data to the plot’s aesthetic attributes. So far we have simply said that Age should be mapped to the x axis and that Fare should be mapped to y. But let’s say we also want to color-code the points on our plot according to male/female. To do so, we will add specifications to this aes() function. ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Age, y = Fare, color=Sex)) Your plot is still blank, but in the background ggplot() is all setup to make your plot. Since this ggplot() call is the basis of everything that will happen next – it contains the data and the way you want to map it to attributes of your plot – let’s save it to a variable for easy recall. We’ll use p for “plot”. p &lt;- ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Age, y = Fare, color=Sex)) Note that you don’t need to write out titanic$Age or titanic$Fare. You’ve told ggplot that your data is titanic, so it knows to look inside that dataframe for those columns. Map our data to geometric shapes. In this case, a scatter plot of points: p &lt;- p + geom_point() p Note the use of a plus sign, +. You are adding layers to your plot. Add some more labels. You see that ggplot() has automatically added axis titles and a legend, but we can add some more using the labs() function. Let’s add an overhead title, a sub-title, and a caption. p &lt;- p + labs(title = &#39;Relationship between Age, Fare, and Sex&#39;, subtitle = &#39;Passengers on the RMS Titanic&#39;, caption = &#39;Property of Eric Keen &amp; Hadley Whickham (2021)&#39;) p Add a statistical summary, like a smoothed regression line. p &lt;- p + geom_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;) p Note that ggplot() automatically produced a different regression line for each sex. That’s nice, but now our plot is getting pretty cluttered. Clean up the look by using facets: a separate plot for each sex. p &lt;- p + facet_wrap(~Sex) p Beautiful! Finally, let’s stylize the entire plot with a different theme. You can find theme options in the `ggthemes package. p &lt;- p + theme_economist_white() p Bar plot In a bar plot, your data are mapped to bars instead of points. And, instead of showing every data point, you are summarizing the data in some way – i.e., displaying a statistic. That statistic is usually just a count of the number of data points in each subgroup. Let’s make a bar plot that compares the number of men and women on the Titanic: ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Sex)) + geom_bar(stat=&#39;count&#39;) Note that, for the aes() call, we only provided the x axis attribute: Sex. Then, in the geom_bar() call, we told R what statistic should be represented by that bars: 'count'. But you are allowed to explicitly set the bars’ heights (i.e., the y dimension) to represent a different statistic. Let’s say we wanted each bar to represent the mean age of men and women: # First, determine the mean age of each sex mean_age_males &lt;- mean(titanic$Age[titanic$Sex == &#39;male&#39;], na.rm = TRUE) mean_age_females &lt;- mean(titanic$Age[titanic$Sex == &#39;female&#39;], na.rm = TRUE) # Make a new dataframe with this summary data titanic_age &lt;- data.frame(Sex = c(&#39;male&#39;,&#39;female&#39;), mean_age = c(mean_age_males, mean_age_females)) # Plot it ggplot(data = titanic_age, aes(x = Sex,y= mean_age)) + geom_bar(stat = &#39;identity&#39;) In this case, we are explicitly defining the y axis in the aes() call, and telling geom_bar() to just use the values we specified in aes() (that’s what 'identity' means; you are telling ggplot() to just use what you already gave it.) You can specify other aesthetic attributes, unrelated to the data, within the geom_bar() call: ggplot(data = titanic_age, aes(x = Sex,y= mean_age)) + geom_bar(stat = &#39;identity&#39;, fill = &#39;blue&#39;, alpha = 0.5) Now add better labels: ggplot(data = titanic_age, aes(x = Sex,y= mean_age)) + geom_bar(stat = &#39;identity&#39;, fill = &#39;blue&#39;, alpha = 0.5) + labs(y = &#39;Mean age&#39;, x = &#39;Gender&#39;, title = &#39;Titanic passengers: Average age by sex&#39;, caption = &#39;Do not steal, please&#39;) You can add another variable to your bar plot as follows. Let’s say you want to see the average age in each sex, grouped by who survived and who didn’t: # First, produce your summary dataframe using some dplyr magic: titanic_em &lt;- titanic %&gt;% group_by(Sex, Survived) %&gt;% summarise(mean_age= mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)) titanic_em &lt;- titanic_em %&gt;% mutate(Survived = ifelse(Survived == 1, &#39;Survived&#39;,&#39;Dead&#39; )) # Check it out titanic_em # A tibble: 4 × 3 # Groups: Sex [2] Sex Survived mean_age &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 female Dead 25.0 2 female Survived 28.8 3 male Dead 31.6 4 male Survived 27.3 # Now plot it ggplot(data = titanic_em, aes(x=Sex, y=mean_age, fill = Survived)) + geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;) Rather than stack the bars, you can place them side by side: ggplot(data = titanic_em, aes(x=Sex, y=mean_age, fill = Survived)) + geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;, position = &#39;dodge&#39;) If you don’t love these default colors (even if they are colorblind-friendly), you can manually define the colors for each group of bars: ggplot(data = titanic_em, aes(x=Sex, y=mean_age, fill = Survived)) + geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;, position = &#39;dodge&#39;, alpha = 0.7, color=&#39;grey40&#39;) + # bar edge scale_fill_manual(values = c(&#39;blue&#39;, &#39;grey&#39;)) # bar fill Exercises More Titanic plots 1. Make a scatterplot similar to what you did above, but this time color-code by class instead of sex. 2. Notice that ggplot() automatically uses a continuous color scale for Pclass, since it has numeric values. To force ggplot() to consider Pclass as categories (1st class, 2nd class, 3rd class), replace Pclass with factor(Pclass). Did the style of your color scale change? 3. Modify the title, subtitle, and caption to be more descriptive. 4. Produce a bar plot that compares the number of passengers in each class. 5. Make your bar plot as ugly as possible! 6. Now make it as beautiful as possible, including a concise but informative title, subtitle, and caption.   Baby names Download the dataset on baby names given to newborns in the USA: library(babynames) bn &lt;- babynames 7.

"],["dplyr.html", "Module 16 Dataframe wrangling The dplyr package The %&gt;% pipe dplyr verbs", " Module 16 Dataframe wrangling Learning goals Understand the importance of tidy dataframes Understand what the tidyverse is and why it is awesome Feel comfortable working with dataframes using dplyr functions. The dplyr package Data scientists largely work in data frames and do things to data. This is what the package dplyr is optimized for. It consists of a series of “verbs” which cover 95% of what you need to do for most basic data processing tasks. install.packages(&#39;dplyr&#39;) # if you haven&#39;t yet library(dplyr) The dplyr package contains a set of verbs: things you do to dataframes. Those verbs are: filter() arrange() select() rename() distinct() mutate() summarise() The %&gt;% pipe %&gt;% is a “pipe”. It is a way to write code without so many parentheses. For example, what if I want to find the square root of the sum of the first six elements of a sequence of 10 to 20 by 2? Here’s what that command would look like in base R: sqrt(sum(head(seq(10, 20, 2)))) [1] 9.486833 Pretty overwhelming, and pretty easy to make errors in writing it out. But the above could also be written a simpler way: seq(10, 20, 2) %&gt;% head %&gt;% sum %&gt;% sqrt [1] 9.486833 When you see the %&gt;% pipe symbol, think of the word “then”. The above code could be read aloud like so: “First, get a sequence of every second number between 10 and 20. Then, take the first six values. Then, sum those samples together. Then, take the square root of that sum.” Using the %&gt;% pipe framework, your code turns from a nonlinear series of parentheses and brackets to a linear progression of steps, which is a closer fit to how we tend to think about working with data. Instead of working from the inside of a command outward, we thinking linearly: take the data, then do things with it, then do more things with it, etc. Here’s another example: mean(sd(1:100)) [1] 29.01149 … could also be written as: 1:100 %&gt;% sd %&gt;% mean [1] 29.01149 dplyr verbs To practice the dplyr verbs, let’s make a small dataframe named people: people &lt;- data.frame(who = c(&#39;Joe&#39;, &#39;Ben&#39;, &#39;Xing&#39;, &#39;Coloma&#39;), sex = c(&#39;Male&#39;, &#39;Male&#39;, &#39;Female&#39;, &#39;Female&#39;), age = c(35, 33, 32, 34)) people who sex age 1 Joe Male 35 2 Ben Male 33 3 Xing Female 32 4 Coloma Female 34 filter() The filter() function is used to subset a dataframe, retaining all rows that satisfy your conditions. To be retained, the row must produce a value of TRUE for all conditions. people %&gt;% filter(sex == &#39;Male&#39;) who sex age 1 Joe Male 35 2 Ben Male 33 people %&gt;% filter(sex == &#39;Female&#39;) who sex age 1 Xing Female 32 2 Coloma Female 34 You can also filter according to multiple conditions. Here are three ways to acheive the same thing: people %&gt;% filter(sex == &#39;Female&#39; &amp; age &lt; 33) who sex age 1 Xing Female 32 people %&gt;% filter(sex == &#39;Female&#39;, age &lt; 33) who sex age 1 Xing Female 32 people %&gt;% filter(sex == &#39;Female&#39;) %&gt;% filter(age &lt; 33) who sex age 1 Xing Female 32 Note that when a condition evaluates to NA, its row will be dropped. This differ from the base subsetting works with [ ... ]. arrange() Arrange means putting things in order. That is, arrange() orders the rows of a data frame by the values of selected columns. people %&gt;% arrange(age) who sex age 1 Xing Female 32 2 Ben Male 33 3 Coloma Female 34 4 Joe Male 35 people %&gt;% arrange(sex) who sex age 1 Xing Female 32 2 Coloma Female 34 3 Joe Male 35 4 Ben Male 33 people %&gt;% arrange(who) who sex age 1 Ben Male 33 2 Coloma Female 34 3 Joe Male 35 4 Xing Female 32 To reverse the order, use desc(): people %&gt;% arrange(desc(age)) who sex age 1 Joe Male 35 2 Coloma Female 34 3 Ben Male 33 4 Xing Female 32 You can also arrange by multiple levels: people %&gt;% arrange(sex, age) who sex age 1 Xing Female 32 2 Coloma Female 34 3 Ben Male 33 4 Joe Male 35 select() Select only certain variables in a data frame, making the dataframe skinnier (fewer columns). people %&gt;% select(age) age 1 35 2 33 3 32 4 34 people %&gt;% select(sex, age) sex age 1 Male 35 2 Male 33 3 Female 32 4 Female 34 As you select columns, you can rename them like so: people %&gt;% select(sex, years = age) sex years 1 Male 35 2 Male 33 3 Female 32 4 Female 34 You can also select a set of columns using the : notation: people %&gt;% select(who:sex) who sex 1 Joe Male 2 Ben Male 3 Xing Female 4 Coloma Female rename() The function rename() changes the names of individual variables. This verb takes the syntax &lt;new_name&gt; = &lt;old_name&gt; syntax. people %&gt;% rename(gender = sex, years = age, first_name = who) first_name gender years 1 Joe Male 35 2 Ben Male 33 3 Xing Female 32 4 Coloma Female 34 mutate() The function mutate() adds new variables and preserves existing ones. New variables overwrite existing variables of the same name. people %&gt;% mutate(agein2020 = age - 1) who sex age agein2020 1 Joe Male 35 34 2 Ben Male 33 32 3 Xing Female 32 31 4 Coloma Female 34 33 people %&gt;% mutate(is_male = sex == &#39;Male&#39;) who sex age is_male 1 Joe Male 35 TRUE 2 Ben Male 33 TRUE 3 Xing Female 32 FALSE 4 Coloma Female 34 FALSE people %&gt;% mutate(average_age = mean(age)) who sex age average_age 1 Joe Male 35 33.5 2 Ben Male 33 33.5 3 Xing Female 32 33.5 4 Coloma Female 34 33.5 You can call mutate() multiple times in the same pipe: people %&gt;% mutate(average_age = mean(age)) %&gt;% mutate(diff_from_avg = age - average_age) who sex age average_age diff_from_avg 1 Joe Male 35 33.5 1.5 2 Ben Male 33 33.5 -0.5 3 Xing Female 32 33.5 -1.5 4 Coloma Female 34 33.5 0.5 You can also remove variables can be removed by setting their value to NULL. people %&gt;% mutate(age = NULL) who sex 1 Joe Male 2 Ben Male 3 Xing Female 4 Coloma Female A similar function, transmute(), adds new variables and drops existing ones, kind of like a combination of select() and mutate(). people %&gt;% transmute(average_age = mean(age)) average_age 1 33.5 2 33.5 3 33.5 4 33.5 group_by() Most data operations are done on groups defined by variables. The function group_by() takes an existing table and converts it into a grouped one where operations are performed “by group”. people %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% mutate(average_age_for_sex = mean(age)) # A tibble: 4 × 4 # Groups: sex [2] who sex age average_age_for_sex &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Joe Male 35 34 2 Ben Male 33 34 3 Xing Female 32 33 4 Coloma Female 34 33 people %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% mutate(average_age_for_sex = mean(age)) %&gt;% mutate(diff_from_avg_for_sex = age - average_age_for_sex) # A tibble: 4 × 5 # Groups: sex [2] who sex age average_age_for_sex diff_from_avg_for_sex &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Joe Male 35 34 1 2 Ben Male 33 34 -1 3 Xing Female 32 33 -1 4 Coloma Female 34 33 1 Note that a similar verb, ungroup(), removes grouping. summarize() summarize() or summarize() creates an entirely new data frame. It will have one (or more) rows for each combination of grouping variables; if there are no grouping variables, the output will have a single row summarizing all observations in the input. It will contain one column for each grouping variable and one column for each of the summary statistics that you have specified. people %&gt;% summarize(average_age = mean(age)) average_age 1 33.5 people %&gt;% summarize(average_age = mean(age), standard_dev_of_age = sd(age), oldest_age = max(age), youngest_age = min(age)) average_age standard_dev_of_age oldest_age youngest_age 1 33.5 1.290994 35 32 people %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(avg_age = mean(age), oldest_age = max(age), total_years = sum(age)) # A tibble: 2 × 4 sex avg_age oldest_age total_years &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Female 33 34 66 2 Male 34 35 68 people %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(sample_size = n()) # A tibble: 2 × 2 sex sample_size &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 Female 2 2 Male 2 Note the use of the function, n().
